Want to revisit from last time, why was that `corr` was super low last time between the cosine similarity hit score, between those fluff phrases and the `sub_phrase_sum`. 

## Take two 

Ok so below, ended up removing some additional punctuation, w/ commit `4039167`. Maybe that helped somewhat, because now below, the correlation is better. 

```python 
import os
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from functools import reduce

import utils as ut

# from earlier, 

repos_dir = os.getenv("REPOS_DIR")
workdir = Path(repos_dir) / "2023-interview-me"
loc = workdir / "2023-08-18T132229-search-result.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(loc)

fluff_phrases = [
  ut.remove_punctuation(x) for x in
  [  "Amazon is an Equal Opportunity-Affirmative Action Employer - Minority / Female / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation",
    'Amazon is driven by being “the world’s most customer centric company."',
    'In the Health, Safety, Sustainability, Security, and Compliance (HS3C) organization, we own ensuring that all products at Amazon are 100% complaint with all legal, trade, product safety, and food safety requirements.',
    'We’re obsessed with the safety of all our customers and workers, creating a world-class experience for our millions of vendors and sellers world-wide, and inventing the best business and regulatory models for safe and sustainable supply chains in our industries.',
  ]
]

one_hot_sub_phrases = reduce(
    lambda x, y: x + y, 
    [
      [" ".join(x.split(" ")[i:i + 3]).lower() for i in range(len(x.split(" ")) - 3)]
      for x in fluff_phrases
    ]
)

# df_highest = df[df.score >= 0.5].copy()
for sub_phrase in one_hot_sub_phrases:
    df["OHE_" + sub_phrase] = df["result"].map(lambda x: int(sub_phrase in x))


cols = df.columns.tolist()
ohe_cols = [x for x in cols if x.startswith("OHE_")]

df["sub_phrase_sum"] = df.apply(lambda x: sum([x[col] for col in ohe_cols]), axis=1)

df[["score", "sub_phrase_sum"]].corr()
```

```python
                   score  sub_phrase_sum
score           1.000000        0.173458
sub_phrase_sum  0.173458        1.000000
```
